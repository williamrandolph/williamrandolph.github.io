## Project Overview

This is a simple static website hosted on GitHub Pages at williamrandolph.github.io. The site consists of basic HTML files served directly from the repository root.

## Architecture

- **Static HTML**: Single-page website with minimal HTML structure
- **GitHub Pages**: Deployed directly from the main branch root directory
- **No build process**: Files are served as-is from the repository

## Deployment

Changes to the main branch are automatically deployed to GitHub Pages. The site is accessible at https://williamrandolph.github.io.
